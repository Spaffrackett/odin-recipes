        <h1>Simple Lentil Recipe</h1>

        <p>Soak the lentils: The secret to preparing the best lentils, and one that I learned from my mother, lies in the way that you prepare the lentils before cooking. Most lentil recipes call for a quick rinse and draining of dry lentils before placing into the cooking pot. But to get the best results, the key is to soak the lentils for about 10-15 minutes in hot water. This not only cleans the lentils (you will notice the dark brown coloured-water when you drain the soaked lentils), but it actually removes the gassiness from them. Meaning, they will be easier to digest and will cause less gas issues once you have at them. You could call it an old wives' tale, but it works. It actually works.</p>

            <p>Lentils have different taste and textures: Another tip to getting the perfect lentil, is to be mindful of the type of lentil you are using. I like to cook with brown lentils because I like their earthy flavour and because they hold their shape really well after cooking. Lentils should be slightly soft or even crunchy, but of course if super mushy lentils are your thing, (which to be honest are pretty amazing), then just keep cooking them until you get the consistency that you are looking for.</p>
            
            <p>How to store: These lentils reheat really well and makes for amazing leftovers. They can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. They also freeze really well and can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>
            
            <p>How to reheat: When you are ready to eat, simply allow the lentils to thaw in the refrigerator and then reheat for a few minutes in a saucepan. The best part is that frozen lentils will taste the same way they did on first day that you made them. This is why I never cook a small batch. I always double up on the recipe so that I can freeze any extras for weeks or months to come.</p>
